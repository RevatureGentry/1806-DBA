Create a database that represents the following:

Doctor can see a patient via different appointments
Doctors may or may not prescribe medicine and/or treatment within an appointment
Doctors can record symptoms, diagnoses, and notes associated with a patientâ€™s visit
	- Have at least 5 patients, 3 doctors, and 20 appointments
	- Include 10 diagnoses with up to 4 symptoms each

Doctor can view his appointments on the schedule for today.
Doctor can view all his appointments within a certain date range.
Patients can view future appointments and appointment history.
Based on the selected symptoms, a procedure would suggest a possible diagnosis if >65% of symptoms match (store combinations of symptoms and diagnoses in a junction table)
Based on diagnosis find the appropriate medicine or treatment 

Design and implement at least 3 additional use cases to interact with the system.

Be able to run these queries/procedures for a demo. Prepare a short powerpoint, including the database ERD in conjunction with the demo. Be prepared to present on Monday in place of your QC.
