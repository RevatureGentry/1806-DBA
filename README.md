## Setting up your Environment
* [GitHub](https://github.com)
    1. If you don't already have an account, create one
        * Your GitHub username needs to be _professional_
    2. We will use GitHub for all class examples and submission of assignments
    3. If you don't already have Git Bash installed, install [this software](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
        * Optionally, in the install wizard, choose the option _Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt_ if you wish to access Git commands from both Git Bash and the Command Prompt
* [Slack](https://slack.com)
    1. If you don't already have an account, create one
    2. Slack will be the main point of communication inside and outside work hours
* At this point, email me the following
    * GitHub username
    * The email I receive this from will be the email I invite to slack!
    * Do __NOT__ reply all
* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
    * If you do not already have one, please sign up for an Amazon Web Services __Personal__ account
    * You will be asked to provide some form of payment. The services we will be using will be under the free tier, however this step is required to complete AWS registration. I don't like paying AWS just as much as you do, so this will be avoided at all costs 
* [SQL Developer](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html)
    * SQL Developer will be the IDE we use for SQL development 
    * __You must have a JDK 8 installed on your machine in order to run SQLDeveloper__
        * If you do not have one installed on your machine, choose the option with JDK 8 included
        * If you are certain you have a JDK v8 installed (open a terminal and type ```java -version``` to verify), choose the option without the JDK
    * Please download the appropriate version
        * 64-bit if you have a 64-bit machine
        * 32-bit if you have a 32-bit machine
        * How do I check if my machine is [32-bit or 64-bit](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001121.htm)?
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a great location for practice
