        <h1><strong>JAVASCRIPT IS FORGIVING</strong></h1>
        <p>For example, every line in JavaScript needs to be terminated with a 
            semicolon. However, if we forget to include one, the JavaScript engine
            will inject one for us where it belives it fits
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="data-types">
        <h2>There are 6 <em>primitive</em> data types in JavaScript. They are</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>string</li>
            <li>boolean</li>
            <li>number (64-bit floating point)</li>
            <li>null</li>
            <li>undefined</li>
            <li>Symbol (new in ES6)</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="new-in-es6">
        <h2>Template Literal</h2>
        <p>A template literal is simplified version of injecting JavaScript expressions
            into strings. To use a Template Literal, we use the ES6 backticks (``)
             and inject our JavaScript inside ${}
        </p>
        <h2>Block Scope</h2>
        <p>The keywords <em>let</em> and <em>const</em> were introduced to help 
         with the pitfalls of using the <em>var</em> keyword to declare variables</p>
         <h2>Arrow Functions</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="truthy-and-falsy">
        <h2><em>Falsy</em> refers to values that are not the boolean false, 
        but evaluate to false. Values that are falsy include:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>0, The Number Zero</li>
            <li>"", The Empty String</li>
            <li>null</li>
            <li>undefined</li>
            <li>NaN</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: null and undefined do not have == equality with any value except
             each other. NaN is not == or === to anything, including itself
        </p>
        <h2><em>Truthy</em> refers to values that are not the boolean true, 
         but evaluate to true. This is every other value except those listed above 
        </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="variable-scopes">
        <h2>There are 3 variables scopes in JavaScript</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Global</li>
            <li>Local</li>
            <li>Block - defined with the keywords <em>let</em> and <em>const</em> (introduced in ES6)</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="functions-in-js">
        <h2>Functions in JavaScript differ from functions in other programming languages in the following ways</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Functions</em> inherit from <em>Object</em></li>
            <li>Functions can be anonymous. By this, we mean that functions can be assigned to variables</li>
            <li>Functions can be self-invoking. This is achieved by wrapping our function in a set of 
                 parentheses and having a trailing set of parentheses for any arguments
            </li>
            <li>Functions can be hoisted. By this, we mean that functions can be invoked in a script 
                 before their implementation
            </li>
            <li>Arrow functions were introduced in ES6 and they help provide a more Object-Oriented feel 
                 to JavaScript. Every time we create a declared function in JS, it creates a new value for 
                 <em>this</em>. If we use an arrow function, it inherits the <em>this</em> value from its 
                 enclosing context.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>


    <!-- A VERY COMMON PAIN POINT -->
    <!-- You must link you JS file to your HTML for any of the code to be connected -->
    <script src="./someOtherFile.js"></script>
    <script src='./helloWorld.js'></script>
    <script src="./variableScopes.js"></script>
